    I am Sai Bharath Kondepati. I completed my schooling in St. Joseph English Medium School later I completed

    master's in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.

<h1>Karna</h1>
<p>I really like Mahabharatham because it is the integral part of Indian history. I really like the 
    character of Karna because we can learn many life lessons through his life. He is always been my
    inspiration and I really love to know about his life always.
